I an in MTH3510 this semester, which is a class in SAS programming. SAS is also used where I work at Fedex 
Express. I have implemeted a simple database to organize data of employee benefits and spending.

SAS is lisensed, however it is on all Metro school computers. You can request to get it on your system with
Metro's IT , but as we encountered  earlier in the semester with Oracle database that will take time.
The program is also almost 20GB so the fastest way to run the file would be on Metro'ss system.

1. Download all files and place in a file caled HW9.

2. Explicit file refersences are required to perform operations in this language so at the top of the file
change  ' C:\SAS\HW9; ' to the correct value for where you saved the HW9 file'DRIVE:\FILEPATH'

		' C:\SAS\HW9; ' ------->   DRIVE:\FILEPATH'

3. run SQL_in_SAS.sas
